# Learning git and github 

Git init - to initialize a repository
# remove .git from excluded file in vs code in settings
git status - tells the current status
# u - untracked
.gitignore - if you dont want your private info to be exposed or unnecessary modules like node_modules
# repository is just some snapshots of some changes
git add - add file for next commit
# git add . - all file in current directory will be added
# git reset . - undo git add

# commit - every commit has a unique id by which git can tell the difference between commits
